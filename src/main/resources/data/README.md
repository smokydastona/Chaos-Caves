# Fractured Lands Worldgen Datapack

This datapack transforms the Minecraft overworld into a massive cave system with a bedrock ceiling.

## Installation

1. Place this datapack folder in your world's `datapacks` folder:
   - `saves/[Your World Name]/datapacks/fractured-lands-worldgen/`

2. Make sure the **Fractured Lands mod** is installed (required for optimal performance)

3. Create a **new world** or regenerate chunks to see the changes

## What It Does

- **Bedrock ceiling** at Y=310 (creates enclosed cave world)
- **No skylight** (always dark like the Nether)
- **Dim ambient light** (0.1 brightness for atmosphere)
- **All biomes spawn** in cave format with proper features
- **Structures spawn** at varied heights throughout caves
- **Trees and vegetation** grow naturally underground

## Compatibility

- **Minecraft 1.20.1** (pack_format 15)
- Works with **all biome mods** (Biomes O' Plenty, Terralith, etc.)
- **Requires Fractured Lands mod** for best performance (handles feature spawning optimization)

## Without the Mod

The datapack will work standalone but may cause performance issues:
- Features may not spawn properly without skylight
- Structures might have placement issues
- More server lag due to feature generation checks

**For best experience, use with the Fractured Lands mod!**

## Uninstalling

1. Remove the datapack from your world's `datapacks` folder
2. Run `/reload` or restart the server
3. Note: Already generated chunks will remain as caves

## Credits

Based on the Better Cave Worlds datapack concept, optimized for Forge mod integration.
